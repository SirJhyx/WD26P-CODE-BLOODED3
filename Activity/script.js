// 1.What is the difference between a comparison operator and an assignment operator?

// 2.What is a Boolean? What does it represent?

// 3.How is the += operator different than + operator?

 //Answer:
//1.  the difference between the two operator is the sign that they use which is represent itslelf, like when we use a comparison operator we use (==) and assignment operator we ise (=) there for = operator is used to assign variable and == operator use to compare two variable

//2. boolean refer as TRUE or FALSE and it represent as TRUE or FALSE

//3. i think the + sign itself use to add a numbers and += sign use to add and compare the two values i guess

// Code Part

// 1.Set two variables equal to two different numbers. Use a comparison operator to compare these two variables. Change one of their values by using the +=, -=, *=, or /= operator. Then, compare their values again.

// 2.Try out the <= and >= operators.

// 3.Try to use the !== operator.
