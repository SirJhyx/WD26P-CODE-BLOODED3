                Six copies of the 1843 first edition of Sketch of the Analytical Engine with Ada Lovelace's "Notes"[65] have been located. Three are held at Harvard University, one at the University of Oklahoma, and one at the United States Air Force Academy.[144] On 20 July 2018, the sixth copy was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for £95,000.[145] A digital facsimile of one of the copies in the Harvard University Library is available online. <br>
                In December 2016, a letter written by Ada Lovelace was forfeited by Martin Shkreli to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance for unpaid taxes owed by Shkreli.
